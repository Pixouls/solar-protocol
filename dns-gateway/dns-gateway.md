# Traffic controller

The contents of this directory run on a server redirected through dns.solarprotocol.net (redirection through dns.solarprotocol.net isn't working currently so we are temporarily using https://server.solarpowerforartists.com)

This handles requests to repoint the DNS and manages the white/black lists.

This server also handles some functionality that we were previously using 3rd parties for, such as retrieving our public IP.

In the future, this function could be added to the internal solar protocol API and be kept "in network"
