    <h6>GUIDE: Developing Projects and Hosting Sites</h6>
    <h2>What kind of projects can run on Solar Protocol?</h2>
    <p>
      Solar Protocol can provide solar powered, community-owned server
      space for web projects and it gives open access to the solar energy
      data from all the server&rsquo;s in the network via the
      system&rsquo;s open API.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide describes some different types of projects that could be
      developed with Solar Protocol, categorizing them as: external
      (projects using Solar Protocol open API data but are hosted
      elsewhere), single server (projects are hosted on a single Solar
      Protocol server and that may also experiment with that
      server&rsquo;s local energy data), or network (projects that are
      hosted on the Solar Protocol software platform, and get served with
      it from whereever there is sun in the network).
    </p>
    <p>
      Projects that utilize and experiment with Solar Protocol energy data
      from the API could be created and hosted anywhere on the web. The
      API is open so these types of projects do not need to be hosted
      directly on a Solar Protocol server and do not require any support
      from the Solar Protocol team. For this reason we call these types of
      projects &lsquo;External Projects&rsquo;. Projects that are to be
      hosted on the Solar Protocol platform and servers, i.e. single
      server or network projects, require various levels of collaboration
      and support from the Solar Protocol team. Opportunities for single
      server and network projects are typically available based on
      specific calls for work or collaboration that we put out
      periodically.
    </p>
    <p>
      External projects are the simplest to produce, single server
      projects are a little more complicated, and network projects can
      potentially get very complex.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Projects</h3>
    <h4>External Projects</h4>
    <p>
      External projects are purely client side projects that use the
      publicly available open API (insert link to API tutorial) to get
      data from Solar Protocol and do something with it. Because these
      projects can be hosted anywhere and because our API is open, you do
      not need to coordinate with or get permission from us (though
      we&rsquo;d love to learn about them). Client side projects could,
      however, also be hosted on a single solar server or on the Solar
      Protocol software platform (see below).
    </p>
    <p>To develop an external project, check out the API tutorial.</p>
    <h4>Single Server Projects – Projects Hosted on One Server</h4>
    <p>
      A single server project is a project that runs on a specific Solar
      Protocol server. In addition to the open API, these projects make
      use of something specific to the server they are running on. There
      are a number of technical and conceptual reasons a project might
      need to run on a specific Solar Protocol server. For example, it
      might require additional types of data that aren&rsquo;t available
      on the public API or it might be engaging with the specific place,
      geographic location, materiality, or intermittency of the server
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One example of a single server project is the Low Carbon Methods
      website. Low Carbon Methods is a lab at Trent University and so it
      was important that the site is hosted at that location, the website
      is also an exploration of intermittency and uses energy-centered
      design principles to communicate energetic aspects of the server.

    <h4>Network Projects – Projects Hosted Across the Network</h4>
    <p>
      Projects can also be hosted on the Solar Protocol software platform,
      that is distributed across all the servers in the network. The
      location where the project is hosted will change throughout the day
      and season. Like the Solar Protocol website, the project will
      therefore be served from whereever there is the most sunshine in the
      network at the time. This option is best for projects that need to
      be reliabily available with minimum downtime, or that seek to
      explore the Solar Protocol network behaviors (the way the site is
      served from different places at different times of the day or
      season). These works may still use data from the API, for example,
      querying how much power is being generated or used at a particular
      moment, at a particualar server.

    <h3>Project Considerations</h3>
    <p>Consider daily and seasonal changes across the network</p>
