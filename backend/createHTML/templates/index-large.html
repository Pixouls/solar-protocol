        Solar Protocol will be an experimental network of solar powered servers
        installed at different locations around the world. As the sun rises and
        sets, each server turns on and off as its solar panel goes into sunlight
        or darkness. When a request to the Solar Protocol website is made,
        traffic is directed to whichever server is enjoying the most sunlight at
        that moment. Different parts of this site are distributed across the
        network and become available at different times of the day, depending on
        which server is active.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system directs traffic using the Domain Network Service (DNS)
        protocol, a decentralized system that resolves a URL to an IP address of
        a server. In short, DNS dictates the path between client and server.
        Typically high volume web services like Google or Facebook will
        configure the DNS to direct network traffic to different servers based
        on their response times which is ususally a proxy for the sending
        traffic to the server that is geographically closest. However on the
        Solar Protocol network, traffic is automatically directed to whichever
        server has the most solar energy available. The distribution of sunshine
        (and therefore energy) across the planet detirmines the path from client
        to server.

      <h3>Natural intelligences</h3>
      <p>
        Solar Protocol reconfigures internet protocols with natural rather than
        artificial intelligence. Presently, much attention is focused on
        automating decisions based on logics derived from massive datasets,
        produced by systems of surveillance capitalism. Web platforms monitor
        our our every click, view and scroll and then use this data to make
        decisions about what content to show us next. Instead, on the Solar
        Protocol platform, decisions about what content is served will be automated
        with a logic produced by the sunâ€™s position and the energy distribution across the network. The network operates with a
        natural intelligence that emerges from the intermittent dynamics of our
        shared environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intelligences derived from digital surveillance and machine learning are
        only made possible in a society powered by cheap energy from fossil
        fuels. Different energy regimes produce different political
        possibilities and limitations<sup>1</sup> and the current cultural and technological status quo 
        both emerges from, and is constrained by the availability of cheap fossil energy. </p>
        <p>Other worlds are possible.<sup>2</sup> </p>
        <p>Working with solar energy to
        power the servers of this network, means the media served must be kept
        small in size and therefore has to omit energy-intensive tracking technologies,
        foreclosing the possibility of online surveillance and the online
        business models that go with it.<sup>3</sup> Solar power therefore
        encourages a faster, lighter internet that is customized to collective
        environmental conditions rather than individual user behavior. Solar Protocol seeks to create a space and platform for exploring natural autonomy and intelligence 
        by reconfiguring internet protocols with the logic of the sun.

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        When we have completed the first phase of this project and have a small prototype network running reliably, we will be seeking 
        additional host sites and collaborators around the world. We will send out solar server kit to several additional host sites in order
        to connect a community of people who are interested in exploring the possibilities of small scale, solar powered internet technologies and natural logics.  </p>
