# Solar Protocol

A system for load balancing and serving content based on photovoltaic logic.
=======
A repository in development for a solar powered network of servers that host a distributed web platform. Project by Tega Brain, Alex Nathanson and Benedetta Piantella. Supported by Eyebeam Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future fellowship.

Content at <a href="http://www.solarprotocol.net">solarprotocol.net</a> is served by whichever server in our network is in the most sunlight at a given time. (We are basing this off of the solar module wattage.)

It is a decentralized network. Each server checks in with the other devices and independently determines if it should be the 'point of entry' (poe) for the system.

Server stewards have the ability to host their own content on the devices as well.

Solar Protocol is an art project exploring the poetics of internet infrastructure; as well as an education and research platform for exploring energy efficient and energy aware web design; and ecologically responsive internet protocols, among many other things.

Our work is inspired by the great work done previously by the folks at Low Tech Magazine.
