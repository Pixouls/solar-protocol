A system for load balancing and serving content based on photovoltaic logic.
=======
A repository in development for a solar powered network of servers that host a distributed web platform. Project by Tega Brain, Alex Nathanson and Benedetta Piantella. Supported by Eyebeam Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future fellowship.

## Installation

https://github.com/alexnathanson/solar-protocol/blob/master/installation.md

## API documentation

## TO DO
* make an installer.sh
* move python templater to server
* check any limits on the DNS api
* find a better way to update IP addresses to add or remove a server
* do we want to include a blacklist to control enrollments?
* figure our how to write the point of contact log
* decide on best security.  eg. could generate an api key and it adds it to each device. 

## FRONT END
* Code for an energy responsive front end is in test-site folder
* To test, set up a virtual environment and install requirements.txt

## FRONT END TO DO
* Set up with real solar data from index.php
* Basic energy data collection for different sized pages and traffic. 
* Energy impact of regenerating page. What's the frequency of this?
