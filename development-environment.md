# Development environment

Instructions for setting up a local development environment for Solar Protocol

Some of the SP scripts rely on the open API and some require private API access. 

Scripts that do not require API keys and will run in a local dev environment:
* create_html.py
* viz.py
* getRemoteData.py

Scripts the require API keys (not currently set up to work in a local dev environment):
* clientPostIP.py
* solarProtocol.py

## Creating and activating the virtual environment

These instructions come from this link, which provides syntax for both Unix/MacOS and Windows.
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment

You should create a virtual environment called 'env'. This will create a directory called env. (This is in the git ignore and wont get pushed to the repo.)

### Create the virtual environment

* Navigate to the solar-protocol root directory
*  run `python3 -m venv env` note the python3 may change depending on your OS and environment paths

### Activate it

Unix/MacOS
* `source env/bin/activate`

Windows
* `.\env\Scripts\activate`

### Leaving the environment

Use command `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment. (This is the same regardless of OS.)

### Installing packages

Install the dependencies from our requirements file, which is located in the solar-protocol root directory

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running Scripts

To run in unix/MacOS:
`ENV=DEV python3 create_html.py`

To run in Windows:
`python3 create_html.py DEV`

Note that 'python3' may be 'py', 'python', etc. depending on your OS and environment.
