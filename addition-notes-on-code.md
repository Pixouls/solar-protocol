# Additional notes on the code


## Admin console

<p>
default password is 'password'
</p>
<p>
The password for accessing the admin console is not intended to be super secure for the time being. It is really just meant to keep casual users out. The admin is sort of a back stage area. Its messy and doesn't have the same aesthetic as the publicly facing parts of the site.
