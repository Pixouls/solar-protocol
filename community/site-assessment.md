# Site Assessment
What physical infrastructure is needed to host a Solar Protocol server?

## Solar Insolation
<p>
Assessing how much sunlight your solar module will receive is crucial to the success of the project. This primarily involves identifying obstructions that may block sunlight during the hours of 9am-3pm.

* In some regions, there are digital tools that may help identify obsctructions based on satelite data.
	* US
		* Google Sunroof
		* PV Watts
	* Germany

</p>

* What is your site's longitude and latitude?
* What are the potential obstructions?
	* If above 23 degress latitude north, the south side needs to be clear of obstructions
	* If below 23 degress latitude south, the north side needs to be clear of obstructions

## Physical Access

* Are you able to site the hardware in place?
* Is it a safe location?
* Can it stay in place for at least a year?
* Can you run the appropriate cables?

## Internet Connectivity

* Does your site have wifi?
* Does your site have an ethernet cable to a router?
* Static vs dynamic public IP
* Port forwarding
	* http - port 80
	* ssh - port 20	
* Minimum speed
	* 25mb/s up
	* 25mb/s down

## Time Commitment

* Installation
	* Hardware installation
		* Enclosure + Electronics
		* Battery
		* Solar module
	* Software installation
		* network details
* Commitment to trouble shooting
	* Checking system operation
* See the community agreement for a detailed breakdown of responsibilities
