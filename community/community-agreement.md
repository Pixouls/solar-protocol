# Community Agreement and Collaborator Responsibilities

An living document outlining the values and collaborative structure of the Solar Protocol project and community.

## Guiding Questions

* Are there changes we want to make to the way we have been working as we enter a new phase of the project?
* How do we set expectations for each other, servers hosts, content developers, and users?
* How do we work together?
* How do we collaborate and is that different from working together?
* How do we express when we don't have availability to work on this project?
* How do we track project progress?
* What does making space for self-care look like in the context of solar-protocol?
* How is labor divided?
* What are some guiding principles for content related to issues like safer-spaces, inclusivity, etc.?

## Project History

The Solar Protocol project began in 2020. It grew out of previous research that Brain, Nathanson, and Piantella had been conducting on energy and UX design. It was inspired by the work of Low Tech Magazine, Joanna Moll, and other researchers and practioners doing important work in this space. The initial prototyping of Solar Protocol in 2020 was funded by $5,000 from Phase 1 of Eyebeam's Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future program. This enable us to construct a prototyope of 3 servers in different locations around New York City.

The 2nd stage of the project in 2021 was funded by a $25,000 award from Phase 2 of Eyebeam's Rapid Response program. This enable us to fund the fabrication, distribution, and installation of server in Dominica, Kenya, Chile, and Australia. An additional server in Canada was made possible through research funding from Anne Pasek at Trente University. A server in China was made possible through funding through an art exhibition.

Additionally in 2021, $5,000 for researching the sustainability of the project was enable through Code for Science and Society's Incubator program.

In 2022, Solar Protocol was award $30,000 from Mozilla to develop content for the network, better support the server stewards, and grow the community around the project.

## Project Organizers/ Leads

Tega Brain, Alex Nathanson (alex@alexnathanson.com), Benedetta Piantella

### Responsibilities

Design and test hardware and backbone of the networked system.

## Server Hosts

Hardware hosts will provide an outdoor physical location to host the server for at least 1 year. They will receive $1000 USD in total for hosting the server. They will receive $500 at the beginning and $500 after 12 months.

### Responsibilities

* Attend 1 hr workshop with Project Organizers about setting up the system.
* Be available for troubleshooting as needed throughout the year.
* Host the server for at least 1 year. If you need to end your involvement for any reason prior to 1 year, you will be required to return the hardware. You will be able to keep the initial $500, but will not receive the final payment. After 1 year, the hardware will become yours. You are encouraged to keep it running on our network, but you can also repurpose it for whatever you want.

## Content Developers

### Responsibilities

Specific responsibilities will vary based on the content being developed.
