# About Solar Protocol

## Project History

### 2020

The Solar Protocol project began in 2020. It grew out of previous research that Brain, Nathanson, and Piantella had been conducting on energy and UX design. It was inspired by the work of Low Tech Magazine, Joanna Moll, and other researchers and practioners doing important work in this space. The initial prototyping of Solar Protocol in 2020 was funded by $5,000 from Phase 1 of Eyebeam's Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future program. This enable us to construct a prototyope of 3 servers in different locations around New York City.

### 2021

The 2nd stage of the project in 2021 was funded by a $25,000 award from Phase 2 of Eyebeam's Rapid Response program. This enable us to fund the fabrication, distribution, and installation of servers in Dominica, Kenya, Chile, and Australia. An additional server in Canada was made possible through research funding from Anne Pasek at Trente University. A server in China was made possible through funding through an art exhibition.

Additionally in 2021, $5,000 for researching the sustainability of the project was enable through Code for Science and Society's Incubator program.

### 2022

A server in Amsterdam, Holland was added as part of the Fiber Festival. This is an important milestone for the project, because we now have servers on 6 continents.

In 2022, Solar Protocol was award $30,000 from Mozilla to develop content for the network, better support the server stewards, and grow the community around the project.
