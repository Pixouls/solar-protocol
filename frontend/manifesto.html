    <h4>Natural Intelligence</h4>
    <p>
      Solar Protocol reconfigures internet protocols using natural rather
      than artificial intelligence. When visiting most large internet
      platforms today, decisions about what content you see are automated
      with a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning.
      Machine learning systems are trained on massive datasets collected
      via online surveillance. They produce logic from patterns within
      their data and use this logic to automate decisions. Most large web
      platforms collect data from every click, view and scroll and then
      use this data to automate decisions about what content to show their
      users. In contrast to this, on the Solar Protocol platform,
      decisions about what content is served is automated with a logic
      produced by available sunshine and energy. The network operates with
      a natural intelligence that emerges from the intermittent dynamics
      of our shared environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our current imagination for the internet and computing at large, has
      been shaped by the energy systems that power it. Cheap, fossil fuel
      energy has produced a culture that celebrates speed and ever larger,
      heavier media. These energy systems have also made current forms of
      artificial intelligence possible. As the author Timothy Mitchell
      observes, different energy regimes create different political
      possibilities and limitations [1]. In Solar Protocol, by changing
      the way a computer network is powered, we aim to expand the
      imaginative potential for what the internet could be, as well as reshaping 
      expectations of it. Other worlds are possible.2
    </p>

    <p>
      Working with small solar powered servers makes it advantageous to
      reduce the size of the website that you want to serve as much as
      possible. This is why we have omitted energy-intensive tracking
      technologies which forecloses the possibility of online surveillance
      and the online business models that go with it.[3] Solar power
      therefore encourages a lighter internet that is customized to
      collective environmental conditions rather than individual user
      behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      By reconfiguring internet protocols with the logic of the sun, Solar
      Protocol seeks to create a space for working with natural
      intelligence and exploring it might change our relationship to the
      internet for the better.

      the age of oil (2011), that discusses the political consequences of
      different energy systems. </p>

      more-than-human politics in a recent talk, On Critical Activism and
      Fungal Revolts (2020).

      Website published by Low Tech Magazine (2019) and we have taken much
      inspiration from this groundbreaking project.
