        Solar Protocol is an experimental network of solar powered servers,
        installed at different locations around the world. As the sun rises and
        sets, each server turns on and off as its solar panel
        goes into sunlight or darkness. This website is hosted on the Solar
        Protocol network and traffic is directed to whichever server is enjoying
        the most sunlight at the time the request for this page is made. Different parts of this site are distributed across the network and made available at different times of
        the day, depending on which server is active.

        The system directs traffic using the Domain Network Service (DNS)
        protocol, a decentralized system that resolves a URL to an IP address of
        a server. In short, DNS dictates the path between client and server.
        Typically high volume web services like Google or Facebook will
        configure the DNS to direct network traffic to different servers based
        on their response times, which is usually determined by the distance
        between viewer and server. However on the Solar Protocol network,
        traffic is automatically directed to whichever server has the most solar
        energy available. Solar Protocol network uses the logic of the DNS is
        determined by the way sunshine and therefore energy, is distributed
        across the planet.
