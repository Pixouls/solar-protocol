      <p>
        Solar Protocol is an experimental network of solar powered servers
        installed at different locations around the world. As the sun rises and
        sets, each server turns on and off as its solar panel goes into sunlight
        or darkness. When a request to the Solar Protocol website is made,
        traffic is directed to whichever server is enjoying the most sunlight at
        that moment. This site is distributed across the
        network and different parts of it become available at different times of the day, depending on 
        where it is being served from.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system directs traffic using the Domain Network Service (DNS)
        protocol, a decentralized system that resolves a URL to an IP address of
        a server. In short, DNS dictates the path between client and server.
        Typically high volume web services like Google or Facebook will
        configure the DNS to direct network traffic to different servers based
        on their response times which is ususally a proxy for the sending
        traffic to the server that is geographically closest. However on the
        Solar Protocol network, traffic is automatically directed to whichever
        server has the most solar energy available. The distribution of sunshine
        (and therefore energy) across the planet detirmines the path from client
        to server.

      <h3>Natural intelligences</h3>
      <p>
        Solar Protocol reconfigures internet protocols with natural rather than
        artificial intelligence. Presently, much attention is focused on
        automating decisions based on logics derived from massive datasets,
        produced by systems of surveillance capitalism. Web platforms monitor
        our our every click, view and scroll and then use this data to make
        decisions about what content to show us next. Instead, on the Solar
        Protocol platform, decisions about what content is served will be automated
        with a logic produced by the sun’s position and the energy distribution across the network. The network operates with a
        natural intelligence that emerges from the intermittent dynamics of our
        shared environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intelligences derived from digital surveillance and machine learning are
        only made possible in a society powered by cheap energy from fossil
        fuels. Different energy regimes produce different political
        possibilities and limitations<sup>1</sup> and the current cultural and technological imagination is constrained by the availability of cheap fossil energy. </p>
        <p>Other worlds are possible.<sup>2</sup> </p>
        <p>Working with solar energy to
        power the servers of this network, means the media served must be kept
        small in size and therefore has to omit energy-intensive tracking technologies,
        foreclosing the possibility of online surveillance and the online
        business models that go with it.<sup>3</sup> Solar power therefore
        encourages a faster, lighter internet that is customized to collective
        environmental conditions rather than individual user behavior. Solar Protocol seeks to create a space and platform for exploring natural autonomy and intelligence 
        by reconfiguring internet protocols with the logic of the sun.

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <h3>Call for Server Stewards</h3>

      <p>  Are you interested in stewarding a server as part of Solar Protocol? A server steward is someone who can host and care for a solar server and who is interested in being a guest collaborator on our project.<sup>*</sup></p>

        <p> 
          We're currently looking for people or organizations in different locations around the world who can host one of our servers for at least a year and who are also interested in contributing their domain expertise to help us explore this network together. We are aiming to establish a server on every continent in the world (except perhaps for Antarctica).</p>

<p> 
  Ideally, a server steward would have a basic understanding of programming (specifically with Raspberry Pi/ Linux) and IT infrastructure to assist us with troubleshooting the installation. However, we are also able to bring on a few collaborators with less experience and who can offer different perspectives on the project. At this point there is opportunity for both institutional collaborators like arts venues and universities that might be able fund their own participation as well as individuals or collectives without these resources. If you fall into the latter group, we have a budget to cover expenses for DIY/independent collaborators. Server stewards should demonstrate a willingness to build community and share materials and resources through teaching and learning.</p>

<p> 
  If you have a sunny rooftop and are interested in experimenting with us, please read the questions and answers below and fill out this brief <a href="https://airtable.com/shrwTVfy9TAvg5oHk">expression of interest.</a>  </p>

        <h3> What are the technical/physical requirements for a server location? </h3>
        <ul> <li>A safe and accessible outdoor area that is exposed to direct sunlight for at least 4 hours per day (this means a spot that is free from obstructions/shadows and ideally facing the equator)</li>
          <li> You need to be able to secure the solar panel to a wall, pole or rooftop so it doesn't blow away or get stolen</li>
          <li> The server needs Internet access either via ethernet cable or wifi (minimum network speed: 25mb/s up & 25mb/s down)</li>
          <li> You need to be able to set up port forwarding for both http (port 80) and ssh (port 20) with your Internet Service Provider to serve the solar protocol network publically</li>
          </ul>
          <h3> What is the timing of this project?</h3>
          <p>We are looking to set up servers with stewards in the first 3 months of 2021. We ask you to steward and care for your server for a minimum of 12 months.  </p> 

        <h3>  Do I need to speak English?</h3>
        <p> Unfortunately our team only speaks English and Italian. We’d be happy to try to find a translator and we would also be interested in translating the project into the language spoken by server stewards.</p>
        <h3>  Keep in touch</h3>
       <p>
       If you have further questions, you can email us <a href="mailto:solar.protocol.info@gmail.com">here.</a> Or to get a very occasional update about this project, please consider joining our TinyLetter <a href="https://tinyletter.com/Solar-Protocol">here</a>.
