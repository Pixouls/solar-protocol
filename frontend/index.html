        Solar Protocol is an experimental network of solar powered servers
        installed at different locations around the world. As the sun rises and
        sets, each server turns on and off as its solar panel goes into sunlight
        or darkness. When a request to the Solar Protocol website is made, traffic 
        is directed to whichever server is enjoying the most sunlight at that moment. 
        Different parts of this site are distributed across the network
        and become available at different times of the day, depending on which
        server is active.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system directs traffic using the Domain Network Service (DNS)
        protocol, a decentralized system that resolves a URL to an IP address of
        a server. In short, DNS dictates the path between client and server.
        Typically high volume web services like Google or Facebook will
        configure the DNS to direct network traffic to different servers based
        on their response times which is ususally a proxy for the sending
        traffic to the server that is geographically closest. However on the
        Solar Protocol network, traffic is automatically directed to whichever
        server has the most solar energy available. The distribution of sunshine
        (and therefore energy) across the planet detirmines the path from client
        to server.

      <h3>Natural intelligences</h3>
      <p>
        Solar Protocol reconfigures internet protocols with natural rather than
        artificial intelligence. Presently, much attention is focused on
        automating decisions based on logics derived from massive datasets,
        produced by systems of surveillance capitalism. Web platforms monitor
        our our every click, view and scroll and then use this data to make
        decisions about what content to show us next. Instead, on the Solar
        Protocol platform, decisions about what content is served are automated
        with a logic produced by the sunâ€™s position. The network operates with a
        natural intelligence that emerges from the intermittent dynamics of our
        shared environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intelligences derived from digital surveillance and machine learning are only
        made possible in a society powered by cheap energy from fossil fuels. Different 
        energy regimes produce different political possibilities and limitations.<sup>1</sup>  
        Relying on solar energy to power our servers, means the pages served on
        this network must be kept small in size and have to omit
        energy-intensive tracking technologies, foreclosing the possibility of online 
        surveillance and the online business models that go with it.<sup>2</sup> Solar power
        therefore encourages a faster, lighter internet that is customized to collective environmental 
        conditions rather than individual user behavior.

        Solar Protocol provides a space to reimagine the interplay between the social,
        ecological and technological.
