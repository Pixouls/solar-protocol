          <h3>Call for Projects and Texts for Solar Protocol</h3>

          <h3>About Solar Protocol</h3>
          <p>
            Solar Protocol is an artwork in the form of a collaborative network
            of solar-powered web servers that collectively hosts this web
            platform. It is an experiment in community-run planetary-scale
            computing as well as functioning as a kind of virtual artist-run
            space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past 18 months, we have worked with collaborators around
            the world to set up custom solar-powered servers in different
            locations. Currently we have people stewarding servers in New York
            City and Philadelphia in the USA, Trent in Canada, Alice Springs in
            Australia, Santiago in Chile, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and
            Nairobi in Kenya. Connected as a network, the servers then host the
            Solar Protocol web platform and when a request is made for the site,
            it is served from whichever server is in the most sunshine, and
            therefore generating the most energy in the network.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use the path of the sun and the weather conditions at each server
            location to program how the network operates. To put this another
            way, the system uses the environment to automate decisions and
            distribute computational work to wherever there is the most
            naturally occurring energy in the network. Decisions like where
            internet traffic is sent and what content is displayed on the site,
            are therefore automated according to an environmental logic derived
            from the season, the time of day and weather conditions across the
            network.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project also responds to the growing energy demands of the cloud
            and online media by advocating for and exploring what low carbon
            internet infrastructure and user experience (UX) design could look
            like. Although work on this project is ongoing, as a fully realized
            implementation of a distributed, community-owned web hosting system,
            powered by renewables, it currently provides solar-powered web
            hosting for stewards, powering several websites including sites for
            the Low Carbon Research Methods group at Trent University, and the
            <a href="http://solarpunk.solarprotocol.net/">
              Extinction Rebellion Solarpunk Storytelling Showcase
            </a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            You can read more about the project on the website, in this paper we
            wrote for the
            <a

              LIMITS 2022
            </a>
            conference, or you can explore the solar data produced by each
            server that is made available through the
            <a href="https://solarprotocol.net/api/v2">project API.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>What sort of projects and writing we want to support.</h3>
          <p>
            We want to support online artworks or critical and creative texts
            exploring the themes of Solar Protocol for publication/exhibition on
            our platform in March of 2023. We are seeking proposals for new
            work, or proposals to show existing projects or texts that engage
            with one or more of the following themes:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>
              Design and exploration with diverse forms of intelligence that go
              beyond existing forms of AI.
            </b>
            The history of AI has been characterized by shifting definitions of
            what counts as intelligence, but that since the enlightenment been
            dominated by human and statistical and machine driven perspectives.
            What should count as intelligence? In Solar Protocol, decisions in
            infrastructure are automated according to environmental limits and
            logics rather than those derived from statistical models and
            historic datasets. The decision about which server to use to serve
            the website is made by the sun rather than by a model or by a human.
            So the environment itself is positioned as an intelligent agent. How
            else might environmental limits and logics be explored as
            intelligent?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Low Carbon cultural practices.</b>
            How can we do cultural and artistic work in low carbon ways? What
            are aesthetic forms that explore data/energy limits provide
            productive and generative creative constraints. What tools could or
            should exist for low energy environments or to support low carbon
            work? What might a low carbon, low data or low energy social network
            look like?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The qualities of solar power.</b>
            What are characteristics and politics of coupling technologies with
            the sun and solar-power? We are interested in philosophical, ethical
            and existential perspectives on intermittency, the cyclical nature
            (daily and annual) of solar energy and on time as a system of
            experiencing the rotation of the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Energy-centered design.</b>
            How do we move from UX to EX, or from user experience to energy
            experience? What does UX and web design look like when it is engaged
            with its energy use or energy sources. See our prompts for an energy
            centered design in this paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              The care, labor and maintenance required to keep infrastructure
              working.
            </b>
            Our servers often go down due to stewards needing to move house,
            connectivity issues, changes in ISPs, water leaks and so forth. What
            does it take to keep websites up?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Planetary scale participatory practice.</b>
            We are interested in reflections or experiments in networked
            collaboration, this could include connecting with or working with a
            server steward.
          </p>
          <p><b>Politics of decentralized, DIY networks.</b></p>

          <p>
            Projects must be html (+css and/or javascript) websites. They might
            respond to the energy data generated across the network that can be
            accessed via our API:
