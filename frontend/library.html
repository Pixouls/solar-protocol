                  Scholars and activists mobilize increasingly the term degrowth
                  when producing knowledge critical of the ideology and costs of
                  growth-based development. Degrowth signals a radical political
                  and economic reorganization leading to reduced resource and
                  energy use.

                  This is an discusses a number of past solar-powered
                  information system designs, comparing them with contemporary
                  solar autarkic prototypes (like Solar Protocol), reflecting on
                  their actors, their histories and their socialtechnical
                  trajectories. Sutherland defines an information system as
                  energy autarkic "if its operation is integrally sustained by
                  an ambient energy source, typically renewable, for long
                  periods of time."

                  Slownet resists surveillance by slowing down the internet. A
                  quote from slownet.work: "Because real-time collection of data
                  is enabled by fast Internet speeds, one form of resistance
                  could involve co-opting a tactic from labor unions called the
                  slowdown strike, in which workers deliberately reduce their
                  productivity. Slow Net, aims to utilize this strategy of
                  purposeful inefficiency in three pieces." Those three pieces
                  are a zine (you must turn off wifi to read it); an online

                  The sun, which, since Antiquity, has played an essential role
                  in our utopian imaginations, is the ultimate source of energy,
                  both productive and destructive. According to Georges
                  Bataille, its infinite generosity can be taken as the model
                  for human societies, which suggests an alternative to the
                  capitalist economy with its infinite expansion, colonization,
                  and disastrous consequences on the cosmic scale.

                  Through unstructured interviews with Maasai herders,
                  city-dwellers of Arusha, Tanzania, and representatives from
                  foreign solar energy firms, this paper explores how the Maasai
                  reconfigure incoming solar energy devices through locally
                  generated knowledges, philosophies, and technologies in
                  calculated efforts to chart their own futures.
