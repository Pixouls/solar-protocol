# Solar Protocol API v3

An API for communicating between distributed Raspberry Pis and making system data accessible

* Network communication between servers on the network is done with POST requests via the /device endpoint 
* Retrieving data from charge controllers is done with GET requests via the /charge-controller endpoint.

## api.py

This manages POST and GET requests on the server

* POST requests allow other devices on the network to update the IP list to account for dynamic IP issues

### publishDevice.py

This script announces the current device information to the other devices on the network

### solarProtocol.py

This script queries the PV data from the other devices and determines if the local device should be point of entry and updates the DNS if so.

### devices.json

This is where mac, ip, timestamp, and device name info from devices on the network is stored. The file needs to exist, but it can be blank... It isn't completely necessary to prepopulate it with the IP addresses, but if not you will need to manually make Post requests or edit the files locally to start everything up.

* name and timestamp aren't required, but may be helpful in the future for debugging

### API Key

The apiKey should be added to the local.json file

### POST

Possible keys for post requests:
* apiKey
* timestamp
* ip
* mac
* name - name of device
* log - log of "point of entry" events

Python Example

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}

myString = "api_key="+apiKey+"&stamp="+str(time.time())+"&ip="+myIP+"&mac="+myMAC+"&name="+myName
x = requests.post('http://www.mywebsite.xyz/api/charge-controller', headers=headers,data = myString)
```

## charge-controller
This manages open access GET requests for local charge controller data

* GET requests allow for querying PV data from the device

### Syntax

clientGetPV.py is just for testing purposes. solarProtocol.py handles get request when they system is operational. You can also use a browser to make a get request.

Possible keys for get requests

* value - returns the specified value from the most recently collected line of data
	* Example: http://solarprotocol.net/api/charge-controller?key=PV-voltage
	* Possible values:
		* PV-current
		* PV-power-H
		* PV-power-L
		* PV-voltage
		* battery-percentage
		* battery-voltage
		* charge-current
		* charge-power-H
		* charge-power-L
		* load-current
		* load-power
		* load-voltage
		* datetime
	* Modifier: duration - returns the specified value over a given number of days, up to 7.
		* Example: http://solarprotocol.net/api/charge-controller?key=PV-voltage&&duration=1
		* Possible values:
			* [integer] - specifies the number of days starting at 1
* line - returns the specified line from the current data logger file
	* Example: http://solarprotocol.net/api/charge-controller?line=0
	* Possible values:
		* len - returns the number of rows in the file
		* head - returns the column headers
		* [an integer from 0 through number if rows-1] - returns the specified line of data from the most recent day of data collected (typically the present day). For example, 0 will return the most recent row of data, 1 will return the 2nd most recent row, etc.
* day - returns all the data for a given day or range of day
	* Example: http://solarprotocol.net/api/charge-controller?days=len
	* Possible values:
		* [an integer from 1-7] - returns the most recent X number of days of data. 1 returns the most recent day of data, 2 returns the most recent days of data, etc.
		* list - returns list of all available files. Each file represents 1 day's worth of data.
		* len - returns the amount of files available. Each file represents 1 day's worth of data.
		* [file name without file suffix] - example: http://solarprotocol.net/api/charge-controller?day=2020-05-17
* systemInfo - provides information about the system
	* Example: http://solarprotocol.net/api/system?key=tz
	* Possible values:
		* tz - returns the timezone for the server
