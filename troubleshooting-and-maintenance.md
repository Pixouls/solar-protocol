# Hardware Troubleshooting & Maintenance

## Best Practices

### Batteries
* Never mix batteries of different types, sizes, manufactures, or ages/ level of pre-existing use in the same circuit.
* Measure battery voltage with a multimeter prior to connecting it.
	*  A 12V sealed lead acid battery should read be between 12V and 13V. Closer to 12V it is about at 50%, which is the lowest it should be. Closer to 13V it is near 100%. Between 11V and 12V it has been depleted below the recommended depth of discharge. Under 11V it can be considered completely dead - you can use a grid powered battery charger to attempt to revive.
* Sealed lead acid batteries typically last 3-5 years, depending on how it was used and the environment it was in. If the battery is older than 3 years consider replacing it.
* Batteries types all have specific appropriate level of depth of discharge (DoD). This means that it shouldn't be depleted below this threshold. For lead acid batteries, the DoD is 50%.

### Wiring Order
Never have the PV module connected to the charge controller without the battery. It is always a good idea to measure the voltage of all components prior to connecting them.

* To install, connect the battery first, then connect the PV module
* To deinstall, disconnect the PV module first, then the battery
* The charge controller should turn on and function with only the battery connected

## Problem Identification

### No output
* Check charge controller output settings
* Measure output voltage with multimeter
* Check OCPD

### Unstable output
* Check battery health
* If battery voltage is below 12V, battery is too small for load and/or not enough sun for an extended period of time
	* Solution: Disconnect/turn off load and wait for a sunny day for it to recharge

### Battery doesn't hold charge
* If battery is older than 3 years old, consider replacing battery
