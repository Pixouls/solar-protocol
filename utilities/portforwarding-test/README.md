# Port forwarding test

Port forwarding is a crucial component of Solar Protocol. It is what allows an external device to communicate with your server on your local private network. <strong>If your hardware is being purchased and/ or shipped to you by Solar Protocol you must confirm that your network can properly enable port forwarding before we send you any hardware.</strong> If you are purchasing your own hardware, we strongly recommended that you test that port forwarding is possible first to avoid wasting your money.

While there are work arounds if your ISP or hardware doesn't allow for port forwarding, we generally want avoid complex routing or tunneling to minimize the amount of hardware not running directly off of solar power.

This test is for residential and small scale commercial networks. It requires that you log in to your networking hardware to make the necessary changes. If you are on a large commerical network, you will likely need to consult with your IT department.

## 1) Set static IP and enable port forwarding on your router

Every router is different, which makes providing instructions difficult. These settings are found on your router's interface. To access your router's interface you will either need to enter a URL or IP address in a browser. This information might be found a sticker on the router, documentation/manuals you received when your internet was installed, or you may need to contact your ISP to find out. Once you have logged in to the router's control panel follow the steps below.

### 1.1) Set local static IP

Your public IP address is assigned by your ISP. A public IP is the IP address used by external devices to communicate with devices on your local area network (LAN). Your private LAN IP is assigned by your router either automatically through DHCP or manually. IPs set with DHCP change periodically, so we need to manually assign a static IP to the device our server is running on. This will ensure that the device's local IP wont change. The Solar Protocol network is designed to allow dynamic public IPs, so it is not a problem if your ISP changes your public IP. 

Locate your device. Typically, it will already have been assigned an IP address from the DHCP server. It is crucial that you dont assign your server an IP address already in use by another device. To avoid this, set your devices IP address to the address is has already been assigned. (On some networks there are blocks of IPs that are reserved for static use. If that is the case, you can pick one of them)

### 1.2) Set ports

The standard ports we use are 80 for HTTP and 22 for SSH. If those ports aren't available because they are being used by something else on your network or by the router itself, you can choose different ports. We recommend 8080 and 8022 as backups.

## 2) Test your port forwarding settings

There are 2 ways to test that your portforwarding settings are working properly. You must do both tests.

### 2.1) Serve HTML content and SSH into your server

For this test to work, you must set up a server to serve HTML content. See the instructions below to create a server for testing. We also recommend that you enable SSH on the server to test that as well. However, we have not found any instance (yet) where port forwarding works for HTML but not for SSH, so if you can't run test 2.1.2, you should be fine. 

It is crucial that you run this test from a device not on your local network. One easy way to do this is through your smart phone. Make sure your device is using cell network data and is not on wifi. Alternatively, you can connect to a completely different network and try to connect to your server. If necessary, ask one of the members of Solar Protocol to attemp to access your test site.

#### 2.1.1) In a browser, go to your public IP address

If you aren't sure what your public IP address is you can find it by going to https://www.myip.com/

If you are weren't able to use port 80, you will have to append your IP address with the port like this:<br>
` 8.8.8.8:1000` In this example `8.8.8.8` is the IP address which is followed by a `:` and then the port number which is `1000`

#### 2.1.2) SSH in to your device

### 2.2) Online testing tools

There are a number of online tools available that can confirm whether your ports are open. Either of these will work:

* https://portchecker.co/
* https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/

Run this test on both your http and ssh ports. If you were not able to use the default ports (80 & 22) you must manually enter the port number when you run the test. The tester will tell you if the ports are open or closed.

## 3) Disable port forwarding

Do not leave port forwarding enabled, particularly for SSH unless you have a proper security measures in place. Go back through step 1 and disable both HTTP and SSH port forwarding.

## Create a server for testing

We recommend you use a Raspberry Pi, which is the computer Solar Protocol uses for our servers. This will allow you to test both the html and ssh ports in exactly the same way we will be using the devices when it is connected to the network.

There are many ways to spin up a server. Follow these instructions to create a Python server.

* If you dont already have Python, you can install it from https://www.python.org/
	* To check if you already have python installed, run this command in terminal: `python --version` or if that command fails try `python3 -V`
* We will be serving the index.html file in the portforwarding-test directory
	* Either download the entire repository or just the index.html file found at https://github.com/alexnathanson/solar-protocol/blob/master/utilities/portforwarding-test/index.html.
* In terminal, navigate to the location of that index file.
* Check which version of Python you are running by typing this command in terminal:`python --version` or if that command fails try `python3 -V`
* Start the server (if you are using a port other than 80 for HTML replace `80` below with your actual port number)
	* If you are running Python2 enter this command to start your server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
	* If you are running Python3 enter this command to start your server: `python -m http.server 80` or `python3 -m http.server 80` or `py -3 -m http.server 80`
* Test your server by opening up a browser and going to `http.://localhost:80`

## Troubleshooting

### Does your ISP allow port forwarding?

Not every internet service provider (ISP) allows for port forwarding. If you can't find your port forwarding settings in the router interface or they appear to be locked, call your ISP to check whether they allow port forwarding.
