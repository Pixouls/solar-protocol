# tests

There are currently two active scripts

## viz

This will 
* grab the deviceList from the active server
* get the latest data
* generate the viz
* create a diff of the viz we made versus the active server

See the `[tests/temp](./tests/temp)` folder for the results

## api/charge-controller

This runs api calls against test data to make sure they work as intended
