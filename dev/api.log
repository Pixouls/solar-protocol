# API v3 changelog

What happens when the gateway goes down?

## general

I think I got 90% of the same functionality in 300 line python script as ~600 php script.

### renames
charge-controller => /charge
networkInfo => /devices # we should change devices.json and this endpoint to be the same
systemInfo => /system
server-status => /status # could be server? overloaded term. maybe device

normalized all responses to be arrays (even if 1 item)

deprecated `time` and just using unix epoch `timestamp`
deprecated response `timezone` since all times in unix epoch / UTC
  - viz/html will need to convert to local at build-time

removed headers for now - move towards 'self-describing data' - see charge controller returns

### endpoint changes

/charge?days={int}&key={pv-wattage|pv-current...|etc..}
/charge/2022-14-12?key={pv-wattage}
  implemented scaled wattage
  implemented `day` path (`/charge/2022-14-24`)
  implemented `days` and `key` params
  renamed `duration` => `days` only supports number, no other arguments
  deprecated 'tracerData' option for `day`
  deprecated 'list' option for `day` (no code seemed to use it)
  deprecated 'line' option for `day` (no code seemed to use it)
  deprecated 'duration' (no code seemed to use it)

/system
  always return a list, even for one item
  deprecated `dump` arg, empty value will work like `dump` used to
  
/devices
  "time stamp" => 'timestamp'

/server
  unimplemented - lets talk about this - maybe we can make a subsite/page that lets you go directly to different servers by IP address instead of proxying information. Unless proxying is the cool part.
  How does this work with the gateway?

/status
  initial implementation - nginx has different info. if uptime is useful we should add that

/ip
  moved from gateway to api!
  need to check that we hash the same way as before

/myip
  moved from gateway to api!
  TODO: should we remove server. prefix, for getting ip address?

/secrets
  changed from bash environment .spenv to /local/secrets.json
  no more worrying eval / parsing in bash
  TODO: need migration plan for existing files
